This repository contains scripts for identifying regions with high fossil preservation potential using climate data (Scotese model), fossil records (NOW database), and sediment zones (Geoscan). We apply the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification to map biomes and compare them with sediment zones across 15 geological periods. Note: The data itself is not stored in this repository and may be updated as the project evolves. For now, the repository focuses on providing the code and methodology for this analysis, with plans for more refined data in the future.
